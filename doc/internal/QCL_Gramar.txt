NOTES:

1. [] means optional, ()* means zero or more, ()+ means one or more
2. I started using the term blob because I was seeing these large chunks of data that
   I didn't really want to figure out how to decode yet. The term stuck and is now
   used throughout the source.
3. The major undecoded blobs are:
    a. All Study Parameters
    b. Daily Snapshot
    c. Data Window
